#numpy is powerful library for numerical computing
#it provides support for arrays, matricies, and a wide range of mathematical funcitons
#to operate on these data structures
#many libraries build on top of numpy (pandas, scipy, scikit-learn)

#numpy is written in C and Fortran, making it very fast for numerical computations

#Create a 1D array
array_1d = np.array([1, 2, 5, 6, 34, 81])

#Create a 2D array
array_2d = np.array([[5, 9, 18],[91, 45, 16]])

#Perform some basic operations
#addition
array_sum = array_1d + 10
print("Array after addition: ", array_sum)

#multiplication

#calculate the mean

#Calculate standard deviation
standard_dev = np.std(array_1d)
